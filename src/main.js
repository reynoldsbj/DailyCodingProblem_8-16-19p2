/**
 * Description: Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each 
 * element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the 
 * original array except the one at i.
 * 
 * Examples: 
 *   1: For input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. 
 *   2: For input [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].
 * 
 * Follow-up: what if you can't use division?
